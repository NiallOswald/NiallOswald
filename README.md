### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year Mathematics student at Imperial College London.

I mainly work with Python, but I have some limited experience in a few other languages.
Most of the projects I work on are numerical in some way, typically being finite difference solvers for fluids problems, like the summer research project I undertook at Imperial College, solving problems involving surfactant immobilisation of Superhydrophobic surfaces using spectral methods.

Currently finishing off my third year, I am beginning to look for a supervisor for my Masters project in the following year.
