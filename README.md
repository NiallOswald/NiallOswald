### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year Mathematics MSci student at Imperial College London.

I mainly work with Python, but I have some limited experience in a few other languages.
Most of the projects I work on are numerical in some way, typically being finite difference solvers for fluids problems, like the summer research project I undertook at Imperial College, solving problems involving surfactant immobilisation of Superhydrophobic surfaces using spectral methods.

Moving into my final year, I am starting work on my Masters project, investigating the behaviour of photosurfactant, under the supervision of Dr Mayer and Prof Papageorgiou of Imperial College London.
