### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mathematics student at Imperial College London.

I mainly work with Python, but I have some limited experience in a few other languages.
Most of the projects I work on are mathematical in some way, be it numerical or symbolic solvers to specific problems, or visualisation tools like the Vortex Sim I've been working on recently.
