### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year PhD Student at the Mathematics for our Future Climate CDT based at Imperial College London.

My PhD is on the Analysis and simulations of novel carbon capture processes, with the objective to formulate models with the aim of utilising mathematical analysis and numerics to simplify and solve these equations to efficiently generate accurate solutions for use in general models of the impact of this device on global CO2 capture.

My previous work focuses on interfacial flows, modelling the chromocapillary effect for spatially dependent light distributions.
